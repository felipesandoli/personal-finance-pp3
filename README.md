## Project Overview

### Project Goals

The objective of this project is to provide an application for managing personal finance. The user can check their balance, add new expenses and incomes and check the total amount spent or earned for each of a set of categories.

### User Stories

- As a user I would like to check my balance
- As a user I would like to check how much I have spent in different types of expenses.
- As a user I would like to check how much I have earned from different sources.
- As a user I would like to log in new expenses.
- As a user I would like to log in new earnings.

## Design

### Project Flowchart

This flowchart demonstrates the logic behind the application:

### Features

The following are a description of the program features when the correct inputs are entered. The input validation errors will be shown in the [manual testing](#manual-testing) section.

- Main menu

The main menu contains 6 options for the user to chose.

- Displaying the balance

This option deducts the total amount of expenses from the total amount of earnings and displays it to the user. A negative amount is shown in red, a positive amount in green.

- Add new expense

Requests the amount and category to the user. Displays the amount and category and asks if the user would like to confirm. Confirming will add the amount and category entered to the spreadsheet in the expenses worksheet. If the user choses not to confirm by entering N, deletes the previous amount and category entered and asks for it again. Chosing the EXIT option will return to the main menu.

- Add new income

Requests the amount and category to the user. Displays the amount and category and asks if the user would like to confirm. Confirming will add the amount and category entered to the spreadsheet in the incomes worksheet. If the user choses not to confirm by entering N, deletes the previous amount and category entered and asks for it again. Chosing the EXIT option will return to the main menu.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8.10 for developing the application.
- Git for version control.
- GitHub for hosting the repository.
- Heroku for deploying the application.
- Google Sheets for storing the data.
- Google Sheets and Google Drive API for retrieving data and adding new data to the spreadsheet.
- Colorama for adding better visual feedback to the user.

## Future Improvements

- Using the datetime python module to add the date an expense or income is being added to the spreadsheet. This would take the current date when the users enter new data.
- Displaying the amount that has been spent or earned for each month/year.
- Add the option for the user to add a description for new data being entered.
- Add the option for the user to chose a category to display all the expenses or incomes for that category with its respective descriptions, dates and times.
